## Description

I am in the process of building this blog application to learn and expand my knowledge and skills of Ruby and Ruby on Rails. This build is allowing me to apply my knowledge of the fundamentals of Ruby on Rails and to expand my knowledge of database associations and how to implement them using Ruby on Rails. This build also allows me to showcase my ability to style applications quickly and effectiely using the Bootstrap framework, and use Git and GitHub for version control.
